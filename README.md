# Desktop-auto-sleep-disable
Hello,
Since most of work computers have an auto sleeps/ teams application might show us as offline.
Some devices lock after 5mins so its difficult so I was able to find a good code for a Excel Macro that will keep computer from going to sleep.

Credits go to the redditor who helped with the code.
